reviews were good but did not address all aspects 9/10

NOTES ON YOUR PLOT
===================

typical plot in finance: complies to tufte's idea of small multiples

y labels should be spelled out, not a variable name with an underscore

axis ration is questionable as the spikiness of the data is enhanced

NOT color blind friently: 10% of man cannot read your plot

===========================================


jml1023
============

unusual but nice location of the legends in two different spots,

nice proportions, appropriate to display the data without getting distracted by empty space

labels too small

not robust to color blindness




mu529
============

interesting plot: the choice of plotting with small points allows the structure in the data to be seen

robust to color blindness

the three default dots in the legend should be changed to 1 as they are redudnant



edl268
============

thick lines are not neessary and cause ambiguity when thy overlab

the datapoints are sparse: the plot could be compressed on the x axisand this would aid comparison

tick labels are ont he small side, but not terribly small 

color blindeness compliant
