#Peer Review for jml1023

##Clarity: 
The graphic is easy to read 

##Esthetic: 
The chosen colors are good, however I don't think it should be two x-axis, it can just use the day and month as x-axis, the legend have already told us about which year lines represent. For the y axis, maybe narrow it to 3000-17000 can provide more detail information of this plot.

##Honesty: 
The plot honestly reproducing the data. There is no distortion.
