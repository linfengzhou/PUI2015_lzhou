# Peer Review for edl268

###CLARITY: 
This plot is easy to read.

###ESTHETIC: 
The plot is beautiful, however, there is only three changes for each line which may mislead the meanings of this plot. Maybe scatter plot(only include three points of each area) is a better solution.

###HONESTY: 
The plot honestly reproducing the data.
