## Documents for Homework 3 
Note: Both Assignment1 and Assignment2 are in Homework3.ipynb.

###Assignment 1 
For Assignment 1, I mainly build a class called Distribution which include all of information such as distribution names, distribution summary statistics and so on, and methods(scatter plot, calculate sample means). The format of Distribution class is Distribution('name'-population means). Using the for-loop function, automatically generate scatter plot as Federica required. I have admitted that one or two plot looks more disperse than others since I didn't revise y-lab. But It doesn't matter me to draw my conclusion. 
###Assignment 2
For Assignment 2, I did z-score test and chi-square test as Federica said.
